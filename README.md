# Soccer_Tranfer_Analysis
Scatterplot in R to compare the transfer fees for soccer players

Research question: How have the tranfer fees for soccer players changed over the years?

Conclusion: In general, we see that the tranfer fees for every position has steadily increased over the years (except Neymar and Mbappe that are outliers). Moreover, I observed that forwards and midfielders are usually signed for a higher fee than defenders and goalkeepers.
